# Sudoku Solver
A simple sudoku solver in C

This is a naive solution, and is therefore horribly inefficient.

To compile:

    make

`./sudoku` will use the file 17_clue_puzzles.txt

`./run_tests` will run against known tests

Credits to Gordon Royle and The University of Western Australia, for creating the 17 clue puzzle set
